What is it?
This is a practice image for securing and hardening an operating system. This practice image is based on Fedora 37 and should help with learning Fedora as well as other Linux internal systems.

Why?
To give some challenges which introduce technologies which students might not be familiar with.

Theme
The theme is Mr. Robot, but really it's just based on a short scene from Season 3 Episode 5 titled eps3.4_runtime-error.r00, and only loosely takes influence. Knowing Mr. Robot won't give any advantage, and doing this image won't spoil any of Mr. Robot.

Getting started
The image should automatically log in. The username and passwords are in the readme file. If you lock yourself out, please reextract and start over.

Forensics Questions
There are a lot more forensics questions than most images. I felt like students don't get enough direction, so virtually every finding in the image gets a hint from a forensics question.
