## What is it?
This is a practice image for securing and hardening an operating system. This practice image is based on Fedora 37 and should help with learning Fedora as well as other Linux internal systems.

## Why?
To give some challenges which introduce technologies which students might not be familiar with.

## Theme
The theme is *Mr. Robot*, but really it's just based on a short scene from Season 3 Episode 5 titled *eps3.4_runtime-error.r00*, and only loosely takes influence. Knowing Mr. Robot won't give any advantage, and doing this image won't spoil any of Mr. Robot.

## Getting started
The image should automatically log in. The username and passwords are in the readme file. If you lock yourself out, please reextract and start over.

## Forensics Questions
There are a lot more forensics questions than most images. I felt like students don't get enough direction, so virtually every finding in the image gets a hint from a forensics question. As you answer the questions, you'll find references to a T number, these correspond to the data found in the MITRE ATT&CK framework at https://attack.mitre.org/matrices/.
